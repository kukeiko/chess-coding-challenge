/**
 * Implement the following function that should return a 2 dimensional string array representing a chess board,
 * where black is represented by "x", and white is represented by " " (a string with just a space).
 *
 * The 1st dimension of the 2-dimensional array should be the row. The 2nd dimension should be the column.
 *
 * Example:
 * const board = renderTextBoard(8, 8);
 * const firstRowSecondColumn = board[0][1]; // should be black, i.e. "x"
 * const fourthRowLastColumn = board[3][7] // should be white, i.e. " "
